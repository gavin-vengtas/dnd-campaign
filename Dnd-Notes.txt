Guilds:

Lawful - GoldFell

Made from Heroes from cities accross the realm, GoldFell earned its name as the "Gold"
standard of adventure guilds, accepting only the most dangerous and High earning requests from lords and kings across the realm. It is mastered by decendants of the Hero of GodFell.

Rodric, the paladin

Neutral - DragonWatch

Also known as the first guild of GodFell, DragonWatch was once the greatest Guild in the realm 
for an age. Not much is known about their downfall, but now theyve become less than a shadow of their former glory. 
It is said that currently they barely have members but the current residence of dragonwatch insist they the 
majority of members are out on highly secretive quests.

Raya - Dragonborn, Cleric

Chaotic - MidnightSun

One of the lesser liked Guilds in GodFell, MS prides itself in its shady dealings in the dark underworlds across the realm. Where GoldFell boasts of might and power, MS exceeds in its dark dealings and cunning plans.

Dextra - Dark Elf, Warlock



Astral Wars 1

Intro 

In a Realm far off, countless distances away from any mortal birth. 
The God Dragon Tiamat grows cold on the eve of her death. Billions of years of
war with the heathen gods of new has branded her infinite formlessness with 
an unknowable exhaustion. But still, she will not flee nor surrender.

Fallen is the God Dragon Bahamut, the platinum.  Who formed the beauties of the mountains and rivers
of the first world. But the heathen followers have claimed the first, for mighty were they
in magic and numbers.

Gone was Sardior, first-born of Dragonkind, Who shaped and breathed life into dragons new, 
but now hides deep within the heart of creation.

Despair! mighty Tiamat, for not even death may have you! The heathen gods bound
and entombed her in torment - sealed in darkness forever, captive to gods laying claim to creation.



Heriarchy:
