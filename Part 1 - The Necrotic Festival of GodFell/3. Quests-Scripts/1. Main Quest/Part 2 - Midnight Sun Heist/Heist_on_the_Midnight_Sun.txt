Intro:

    Ages pass on the material plane. Old rivers dry out and new rivers form, mountains grow and crumble as
    the passage of time passes. In this age, which some call "the age of legends" or the 4th age to some 
    scholars in the world of Gallinor, 5 unlikely adventurers find themselves licking their wounds inside the old Guild of Dragonwatch.

    In the age of legends, it is said that heroes were forged in mighty guilds such as these. Dragonwatch, sometimes 
    referred to as the first guild, was once home to the mightiest heroes known to the world of valinor. Powerful Slayers of Gods, Demons, Angels, abominations and mortals alike. 
    ALL beings met the crosshairs of the once great dragonwatch, now only a measly shadow of its former glory. 

    On this day, the 2nd day of Necros in the 4th century of the age of legends (The year 412) the wise wizard Vilsara,
    guildmaster of Dragonwatch, plots the return of her guilds glory. 


Act 1: Vilsaras offer

    beams of sunlight pierce the drawn dark maroon curtains of Dragonwatch and lit the particles of dust suspended in the air,
    lighting the dusty room that now housed our adventurers with a dim warm, cozy sunlight. The old wizard vilsara sits down with the party
    to explain her plans.

        Dialog:
            Vilsara: 
                - (Expectantly) "Come now, im sure you all have many questions, but first we must tend to you. Coming back from death weighs heavy 
                    tolls on the body." she looks on at Malfeasonce with sad eyes and a warm, empathetic smile, then waves her hand while making complex
                    light gestures with her fingers. A sudden seam forms near or around the air near each player, seemingly tearing at reality and a large 
                    mug of liquid falls out. the liquid is hot and has a dark milk like brown color, its frothy, and a has very sweet aroma. 
                    "Itova iri [Draconic - 'loved ones'], this I received in my travels beyond IOs tear, from a community of necromancers hidden away in the snow woods.
                    Drink. It will relieve the stress of rebirth on your bodies."

                (Dragons returning?)
                - 

                (Why are the adventurers here?)
                - (she takes a deep breath, the tips of the lit candles around the room seem to pull toward her, then flairs up as she exhales)
                    "Right, lets get to it.". She stands up, "Itova iri [Draconic - 'loved ones'] a great scheme is afoot. It appears that there are forces at play that are working hard to
                    see the downfall of Dragonwatch, and as it appears, the lot of you as well. In recent years, our numbers have been hunted out and killed and the reach of Dragonwatch over
                    Zamarok has dwindled." the once dry and dusty wooden floor where she stood now grew moist with drops of tears. (she sighs) "My children are now mostly gone, save for
                    a few special souls.", she gives a sad smile and gestures toward Raya, who sat silently on the floor near the fireplace, her long silver tail wrapped 
                    around her legs.

                    "You lot are being targeted, by the same forces that slaughtered my children. But not for much longer.". she turns to face the party, the candles around
                    the room burning violently, almost hissing. "Join Dragonwatch, there is room for all of you. And I will mould you and give you the power to seek out
                    and smite the mightiest of enemies. whether it be mortals or gods.", the candles around the room seemed to die down to their natural states.
                    "Help me build our ranks once more and restore honor to the halls of DragonWatch. And in return, you shall know power the likes of which Zamarok has not seen
                    in 3 ages."

                (Whats next?)
                - "The bruha Dextra of Midnight Sun, she will know pain far beyond that of any of my children", the candle fires start to flare up again, "but first she will lose everything".
                    "Itova iri [Draconic - 'loved ones'], our first mission is to infiltrate Midnight Sun, we will raid her vaults and take back what is ours, and perhaps more". she smiles and 
                    looks up with fire in her eyes. "But first, we'll need the help of some specialists.", the old woman stares into the fire, lost in thought, and pulls out a poker to stoke its flames. "a halfling,
                    a tiefling and an orc". She turns around to face the party, her tears now replaced with a grin of excitement. "Oh how exciting! We've not done a heist since
                    me and the boys nicked the treasures in king aslims citadel in the north!".

                    Raya looks up in disbelief, her silver scaled face shone a red tinge of embarresment, "Mother!".

                    "Oh come daughter, by now even you should know that not all of our endeavers over the ages have been... Lawful", she smiles innocently.

                (finishing up)
                - "First i suggest you find Alaan looselock the halfling. the old ankle biter has a knack for stealthy missions like these. if were to take everything back from Dextra, he'll know where to start. You'll find
                    the halfling drunk at 'The dancing titan'", The old woman walked up to the fireplace and grabbed a small portrait off the mantle. "Next you'll need to keep an eye out for this young tiefling woman", She
                    hands the party the portrait, which is painted in the image of a sleek looking orange tiefling woman with green eyes and red hair flowing down to her waist. "Lunara Hellborne was once of our ranks, till she
                    left to work for Midnight Sun, ammicably of course... i've heard rumors that she's recently fallen on bad terms with Dextra and has gone into hiding. Find her. Bring her home. No doubt she could help our cause..."
                    She shakes off the worried look on her face "...and lastly we'll need an orc woman, Roxarr Fengarr. her strength is unmatched in GodFell. I happen to know that she'll be defending her title this evening at the trials
                    of Gendrick. do be sure to speak to her too."

                    She turns to Raya, "Itova ir [Draconic - 'loved one'], you must travel into the city for supplies to accomodate our new residents". Raya curtsies toward Vilsara, "It shall be done mother."

                    and poor some mead for the maiden waiting eagerly at the end of the bar with her tray.

                (have your seen alaan?)
                    (looking puzzled) "alaan? you mean looselock? thats the old drunk right there", she gestures toward the end of the bar toward an 
                    old halfling that seems to be talking up a very tall and attractive half elf woman dressed in red, who seemed nearly three times his size.

            Alaan looselock: 
                
                [After being approached]

                    elf woman leans in and whispers into his ear, kisses him on the cheek then leaves. 

                    "Ah, your with villy arent ya? troubling news about yer guild aye ladsh? troubling indeed.", he turns to the bar to finish his drink. 
                    "Villy tellsh me that sticky witch has taken some important things from her. thingsh *hic* she needs returned for the sake of her guild.
                    I CAN help. but first i need you to help me.".

                    The old halfling goes silent for a moment, pondering or perhaps recalling an event that happened long past. "Its my brother, i need his body."

                    The greying thief tells the party about the time he went on a heist with his brother Rada many years ago, that involved going into the Catacombs under the city.
                    while making their escape, they were attacked by ghastly creatures. Alaan managed to escape but his brother never did.

                    "I've never gone down into the Catacombs since... (he sighs) find my brother, please, so that I may finally put him to rest. I'll even pay yee fer
                    the trouble."

                    he hands the party a pale blue orb. "This is enchanted to find our clans badge, it'll grow warm when your close to...", he pauses for a moment then sighs, "to

                seemingly magnify the size of her eyes and smiles, "Im glad to see youre all in one piece. A little yellow bird told me that youve decided to join
                DragonWatch, that fills me with so much joy! oh Vilsara was in need of a fresh pair of muscle to help the guild". Her excitement quickly dwindles, and 
                you can see sadness building behind her oversized spectacles.

                *2 thugs enter the store, look around briefly, then rush out*
                
                [before the party leaves]
                "Wait! Theres a woman here, one who needs your help! Please! Come with me.". She takes the party to the back of the store, and down some stairs to a hidden
                room under the staircase. The room is adorned with a small window that overlooks the river that runs under the bridge, a light breeze blows through the 
                curtain and a on the bed in the middle of the room sat a young bald orange tiefling woman covered in bandages, the woman sat upright with a sudden shock 
                when she heard the door open, almost as if to flee. She had a single green eye and her other eye was greyed out, she was also missing several fingers on 
                both hands and a leg. Her eyes seemed baggy, as if she had not slept and had been weeping.

                Serafia moved slowly toward the girl, then sat beside her and gently stroked her hand. "Her name is Lunara. That spineless no good witch and her cretins from Midnight Sun
                did this to her. DEXTRA! There arent enough magics in the realm to protect you from what im going to do you!", the old woman took a breath to try and fight back the tears 
                that was building in her eyes and regain her composure. "The barbarians cut off her tongue so she couldnt talk... cut off her fingers so she couldnt weave magics... cut off
                her legs so she couldnt run... they defiled her... did things to that would make bhaal himself proud". The old woman spat on the floor.

                "Please, escort the child back to DragonWatch. Vilsara must know whats become of her daughter. Dextra has men looking for her. be careful. Also, im afraid one of you wll have

                    The old womans fingers twitched subtly, as if something within her had finally snapped. she slowly approached the limp tiefling, and placed a gentle hand on her cheek.

            7.

                the ground floor seems abuzz with activity, many guild members as well as guests seems to be on this floor.

                1. the basement entrance/Bathroom:

                        Dialog:

                            Roxarra: 

                                - [Confidently] "Ah, there you are Dragonlings! for a moment I thought you were lost down there, did you manage to 
                                find Festus? ive asked around the guild about him, word is he hasnt been seen for months... that alone is not that unusual, Festus is 
                                known to disappear every now and then, part of the job of a guildmaster of a spy guild such as this, but theres more...", she looks
                                on as if seemingly looking passed the door. "It seems that there are some guild members Loyal to Dextra, but not all of them.... A good
                                number of the senior guild members suspect foul play, that Dex has kidnapped the old fool" 

                                Roxarra looks down the stairs worriedly, "Some of the members tell me that there are strange things going on under the guild, strange noises
                                and strange smells... some say that on silent nights they can hear the wimper of children, some say ghosts haunt these walls."

                                she sighs, "most of the guild members like me, but i cant get them to talk much further. maybe you lot will have better luck? coaxing more info
                                from the seniors of the guild, I know some of them and can give you the details you need to know about them. were going to need atleast one of them
                                to invite us upstairs so we can get passed the guards."

                                she looks seriously at the party, "Look, I know you all want to stick it to Dextra bad, but the majority of folks in this guild want nothing
                                to do with her, and the ones that do stand up to her disappear. try to keep it quiet while were up here, yeah? besides theres dozens of guild members hear tonight and
                                only 4 of us. Thats a fight even IM not confident we can walk away from."

                                

                                    details:

                                            "Reminds me of Dextra a little that one. her moods are all over the place and she can be down right unpredictable.
                                            she likes being challenged that one, not so much losing. Also I hear shes into woman"

                                        2. Core:

                                            "Core is the guilds master Craftsman, he does most of the designs for specs for the guilds complex machinery,
                                            I suspect he might have some insight into on the Vault, but hes a suspicious one, very paranoid... Hes also a massive 
                                            flirt, not sure theirs a living thing he wont try to get with. That said, hes still good people."

                                            - Amanada was raised by cultists of the Final Tyrant.

                                            "I remember when they rescued that one from a group of cultists years ago, Festus took her in personally and raised her as his own.
                                            their isnt a command or order that she wont follow without question. I wonder if she even misses the old fool..."

                                        4. Gulla:

                                            - Female Dwarf Sorcerer

                                            "Gulla is a quiet one, though ive heard whispers of her... horrid experiments. Odd rituals and strange monsters seem
                                            to be about whenever shes involved with something. not sure what to make of her personally but im told that Dextra holds the Dwarf
                                            in very high regard"

                                        5. Alrith: 

                                            - Male Human Rogue,

                                            - Alrith has an animal companion, a dire rat named Houneue.

                                            "Alys one of the oldest members of this place, and one of few to openly stand up to Dex. Hes good people, a little grey but the man 
                                            can still throw a punch, let me tell you". Roxarra rubs her jaw and looks off into the distance as if thinking fondly of an old memory.

                                            "He used to be one of Alaans pages back in the day, and probably the only person here i actually trust a little."

                                        6. Ningal:

                                            - Ningal seeks to free herself from an ancient curse.

                                            "Dont know much about that one, mostly cos ive never really seen her. From what ive heard, she mostly just keeps to her room"

                                        

                2. main lobby

                    The main lobby seems to have much foot traffic tonight, there are far too many people and too much activity for anyone to notice the 3
                    disguised party members. The sound of laughter and music can be heard in the west, loud noises and the sound of people barking orders followed
                    by the smell of fantastic aromas come from the northeast room, and a set of spiral staircases sits in the middle, guarded by an extremely large orc in
                    heavy armor.

                    Dialog:
                    
                        Roxarra: 

                                - [Confidently] "You see that orc over there?", she points to the giant orc standing near the staircase. Roxarra was easily
                                twice the size of a normal man, but even she seemed miniscule next to the giant orc. "Thats Lok, back before me, he used to be the
                                champion of the colliseum. I heard stories about that one. brutal stories. he wont let anyone upstairs without the express permission of
                                any of the guild seniors. try anything funny with HIM, and i doubt even the combined strength of Vilsara and Vasha could put you back together."

                                She points at the entrance to the guild, "That crazy blond bitch over there is suse, careful of her, ive seen nail men to walls for just
                                looking at her, shes unpredictable and always looking for trouble."

                        Suse: (When approached)

                            - [Excitedly] "Ha Haa! i havent seen you lot in here yet, that some fine costumes you have on", she reaches over to touch the mask of the closest
                            player and whispers. "I can see you staring under that mask, the last person to do that had both their eyes fed to Cece", she draws her dagger.

                            Roxara whispers, "Cece is her creapy pet owl."

                            Roxarra/Alrith will step in to stop a fight from occuring and lead the party to the entertainment area.

                3. Kitchen

                    The doors leading to the kitchen seem to have steam creeping out of it, along with many pleasant smelling aromas.

                    as the party enters the kitchen, they are immediately hit with a wall of hot steam, as it clears, you see the kitchen is abuzz with activity.
                    The kitchen is filled with many aromas, Honeyed pork ribs, beef and vegetable stew and the sweet aromas of various cakes and deserts. its very rowdy with the sound
                    of chefs barking orders as waiters bustle in and out of the kitchen.

                    Dialog:

                            Amanada: 

                                - [Quietly] "You clearly do not belong here, what are you lot doing here? the entertainment section is down the main hall"
                                Amanada looks preoccupied with overseeing the kitchen tonight, "If you need something, im affraid ive not the time to help,
                                i have orders to follow. unless you intend on assisting us with the feast, i suggest you leave or stay out of our way."

                    activity:

                        Help Amanada and the chefs prepare the feast.

                4. Lounge/Dining room    

                    The lounge is bustling with activity, loud tavern music is being played on the stage to the south as various guildmembers and there guests can be seen
                    eating at the tables. some of the patrons run up to Roxarra, begging for her autograph, she abliges and then waves them off. the air in here is thick with 
                    aromas of food and pipe smoke.

                    Dialog:

Act 8.1: The Prison

    to loom in the air. A faint buzzing sound can be heard but from no discernable direction. As you walk through the prison,
    you notice that there is an absurd amount of blood and strange symbols covering the walls. the stench smells of rotting meat, 
    and grows fouler the further you go. there is an abundance of maggots that swarm around the floor.

                The sound of children laughing can be heard coming from room 2, the sounds are faint, but the distinct high pitched sound

                    the room, after some time, a creature starts to seep up from the glowing symbol, seemingly from
                    nothingness. the ground around it starts to putrify and it lets out mind numbing noise that blurs you vision when you get to close.
                    it is an amorphous mass of mouths and eyes that propels itself by oozing forward, fastening several mouths to the ground and pulling its bulk behind.
                    its mouths begin to murmur and chatter, each with a different voice: deep or shrill, wailing or ululating, crying out in agony or ecstasy. 
                    his cacophonous gibbering overcomes the senses.

        8: 

            The trails of blood lead you to a row of jail cells, its much too dark to see into the cells from the outside, but the sound of scratching and chittering
            can be heard coming from a few of them. the buzzing noise you heard earlier starts to grow slightly and the smell of rotting corpses fills the air. its enough
            to make the player characters gag and there is an increased presence of maggots and flies.

        9:

            You open the door to find a white room, completely void of any filth, blood or maggots. not even a speck of dust. In it sits a woman on a chair.
            You recognise her to be Emir, the Jailor. She seems to be completely still, but still breathing. the woman quickly opens her eyes, and her eyes dart accross the room, looking
            for something unseen. She starts to babble in a language not recognised, while she also begins to sob and cry. After some time she stops, and addresses the party through
            the tears.

            Dialog:

                Emir: 

                    - [Sobbing] "Please! Please free me! I'll do anything!", she coughs up a small maggot, clearly seen against the contrast of the bright
                    white floor and walls, "Please! I've only done as i was told!", small pustules start to develope everywhere on her skin and eventually grow
                    into large bumps, Shortly after, maggots start to burst forth from them and the clear transparent tears that ran down her face start to turn
                    deep crimson red in color. The pustules grow ever more, her body starts to bloat and deform, growing to an enormous, unattural size. blood starts
                    to seep from the pores on her skin that has now expanded and cracked under the pressure of the bloating. within a moment, her body explodes, spraying
                    the room with blood, worms and pieces of the former jailer.

        10:

            The room is filled with piles and piles of corpses of every kind. Men, women, children. All of them seem to have had their flesh ripped from their bones,
            and lie in mangled positions, most seem to be missing various body parts. Several creautures spiky lipless creatures seem to feasting on some fresh corpses
            nearby. But they are too preoccupied to notice the party.

Act 9: The Vault

    The Square shaped column of tiles begin to move downward, at first slowly but gradually faster and faster until it comes to an abrupt halt.
    the air at the base of the moving column is thick and humid with not a light in sight. the room around the party is pitch black. Suddenly a sconce
    flares up revealing a wall at the end of a room, then another, then another. revealing a large circular structure filled with gold and jewels that
    shimmered under the light of the lit sconses. at the end of the room sat 5 pedestals, with a bracelet sitting neatly in the middle of each of them.

    the faint buzzing sound once heard in the prison now grows louder with each passing moment, till the buzzing becomes deafening and then, maddening.
    each player begins to feel light headed and loses balance as they fall unconcious.

            The Dream:

                You each share a Dream, and find yourselves drifting amongst an earthless sky, endlessly. wherever this place is, time passes very differently
                here, with the sun rising and setting every few moments. the wind blows hard and cool, at some moments giving your formless bodies respite and others
                invoking the feeling of your skin being flayed by the harsh friction of the unatural wind, Friction that grows hot, heating the air around you till
                everything catches flame, flame that warms the soul, feeding it, engorging it. you feel the flames burning all that you are to cinder, burning away everything
                that is and leaving naught but ash. Ash builds and settles, moats of dust form and take the shape of gargantuan mountains of indescribable beauty, baron
                and void of all life. Rivers begin to flow from the mountains, first a small trickle that cut through the rock like a blade through flesh. At nought but trickles,
                the river soon grew into an ocean that engulfed everything that was, and where there was baron land now stood the infinite depth of the abyss below the endless
                waters. From the depths, came a form that took shape. A form harsher than all the winds, hotter than the primordial flames, a thousand fold larger 
                than the greatest mountains and more terrifying than the endless depths of an infinite ocean. its tendrils of pure darkness engulf you, and pull you below till
                naught is seen but the void of nothingness.

                suddenly, there was light. bright enough to empregnate the nothingness. blinding. inspiring. warming. cooling. the bright platinum light fills you, becomes you.
                
                A little girl stands on the bridge of godfell, she holds the hands of both her parents, excited to watch the festivities begin. The light flashes, showing 
                an image of a young fox, playing in a field. another flash. the girl is older now, a teenager, shes practicing incantations from a book and learning spells.
                the light flashes. The fox can be seen hunting small animals in the wild. Another flash. The young woman is unpacking her bags in a small room in midnight sun with 
                several other young people. another flash. The fox sleeps in a den surrounded by cubs. Flash. The woman seems to be sitting in a circle, attempting a ritual. Flash.
                The fox is attacked by a black dire wolf. its flung against a tree and its neck is broken, the wolf stands over it and coughs up a mass of rotting flesh and maggots.
                Flash. The foxes body lies dead and decaying, its lively body now a home to countless horrors. the flashes stop and you each hear a familiar voice calling out to you.

            Alaan:

                [Desperately waking up the party] "Wake up! I say wake up you heavy footed foul giant... ah, finally! you lot are awake! youve been gone nearly an hour! what happened!?"

            Dextra: 
                
                (After the players wake up from being knocked out by Alaan)
                The lights around the room begin to shimmer and slowly fade, as the growing shadows begin to undulate and
                take shape. growing into a mass that took on the shape of a woman. [In a soft low voice] "So, youve finally found your ssssilly
                little trinketsss, they'll not be of any use to you here... or anywhere." she looks at Alaan and in a single motion hurls several obsidian
                daggers at him, seemingly formed from the nothingness that surrounded her. The old halfling managed to expertly dodge the surprise blades, save for
                one that knicked his cheek. "It is Hubris to think that you can challenge the Elders, whom even the gods fear".

                she produced another obsidian dagger and raised her arm in another motion but at the peak of its motion it stopped. 
                her eyes grew big and the expression on her face grew from indifference to complete horror. Tears begin to seep from her eyes as
                her body and her voice began to tremble. "P-please... Please... Please kill me!", the arm with the dagger came crashing down and 
                pierced her abdomen and thick dark red blood began to form around the lodged blades hilt and she began to cry. "Please! I cannot bear it!
                The pain is too great!". She stabs herself twice more, the blood from her wounds pooling around where she stands. "IT tortures me! every day
                it skins me and flays my bones, every day it defiles me for its spawn, for its evil ends!". she stabs several more times, an unattural amount of
                blood now poor out of her wounds like an open faucet, its crimson hue now lost to a dark black sludge that smelled like rot and decay. "Please...
                tell my parents... tell my parents...". she threw her head back and screamed out in pain as the bones along her arms and spine begain to buckle and break.
                the bones under her face begain to shatter and reform, and her visage was now of something completely alien and unatural. tumors now grew all over her skin,
                and a hole had formed in her other hand, from it protruded a bone. she pulls out the protuding bone to produce a seemingly made of bone and rib.

                Alaan doubled over coughing violently, with each cough he has spat out a assortment of worms and maggots. he looked up at the form that
                once was Dextra and cried. "What...What have you done to me!?" his coughs rapidly grew more violent and he threw up scores of worms and maggots
                before falling over backwards. in an instant, worms had began to violently crawl out every orifice on Alaan, any movement the halfling made now
                was from the wriggling creatures under the skin on his lifeless body.

                the pools of black blood around the creature now begins to rise and take shape, revealing 2 more creatures. both creature resemble that of a large eyeless
                worm the height of a large man, about 2 metres long. one is clothed in a rich blue robe while the other wears rich purple one.

        Dialog:

            Post Encounter:

                The Alien being that was once the warlock Dextra dropped down, nearly lifeless. tiny ripples start to form under its skin, its body starts
                breaking and changing once more to reveal a form made up entirely of a countless number of worms. it attacks the nearest player character with 
                a bolt of 9d10 force damage.

                Suddenly the air at the south corner of the room seems to his and the fabric of space seems to tear at the seems. And through it steps out a heavily injured
                and limping Vilsara. the silver haired woman held out her arm and whispered an incantation, while producing a small bright gem in her hand. The gem turned to dust
                and a bolt of bright platinum light leaped from her hands and engulfed the husk of worms standing before her. the body of worms exploded, into a countless number
                of wriggling pieces, before escaping and burrowing into the dirt and grates below.

            Vilsara:

                "Itova Iri! thank the platinum one you are still safe! the worst as happened! Godfell is under siege! where is Alaan?"

                (After learning of Alaan)
                Vilsara drops to her knees at whats left of the corpse that once was Alaan, "Old fool, thats what I am for roping you into this.
                rest easy now my friend. your brother awaits you, and I shant be far behind".

                She takes a deep breath. "Now, each of you pick a bracelet, one that resonates with you. It is time I showed you what it means to be a champion of Dragonwatch."
