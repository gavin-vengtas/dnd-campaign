Intro:

    Ages pass on the material plane. Old rivers dry out and new rivers form, mountains grow and crumble as
    the passage of time passes. In this age, which some call "the age of legends" or the 4th age to some 
    scholars in the world of Gallinor, 5 unlikely adventurers find themselves licking their wounds inside the old Guild of Dragonwatch.

    In the age of legends, it is said that heroes were forged in mighty guilds such as these. Dragonwatch, sometimes 
    referred to as the first guild, was once home to the mightiest heroes known to the world of valinor. Powerful Slayers of Gods, Demons, Angels, abominations and mortals alike. 
    ALL beings met the crosshairs of the once great dragonwatch, now only a measly shadow of its former glory. 

    On this day, the 2nd day of Necros in the 4th century of the age of legends (The year 412) the wise wizard Vilsara,
    guildmaster of Dragonwatch, plots the return of her guilds glory. 


Act 1: Vilsaras offer

    beams of sunlight pierce the drawn dark maroon curtains of Dragonwatch and lit the particles of dust suspended in the air,
    lighting the dusty room that now housed our adventurers with a dim warm, cozy sunlight. The old wizard vilsara sits down with the party
    to explain her plans.

        Dialog:
            Vilsara: 
                - (Expectantly) "Come now, im sure you all have many questions, but first we must tend to you. Coming back from death weighs heavy 
                    tolls on the body." she looks on at Malfeasonce with sad eyes and a warm, empathetic smile, then waves her hand while making complex
                    light gestures with her fingers. A sudden seam forms near or around the air near each player, seemingly tearing at reality and a large 
                    mug of liquid falls out. the liquid is hot and has a dark milk like brown color, its frothy, and a has very sweet aroma. 
                    "Itova iri [Draconic - 'loved ones'], this I received in my travels beyond IOs tear, from a community of necromancers hidden away in the snow woods.
                    Drink. It will relieve the stress of rebirth on your bodies."

                (Dragons returning?)
                - 

                (Why are the adventurers here?)
                - (she takes a deep breath, the tips of the lit candles around the room seem to pull toward her, then flairs up as she exhales)
                    "Right, lets get to it.". She stands up, "Itova iri [Draconic - 'loved ones'] a great scheme is afoot. It appears that there are forces at play that are working hard to
                    see the downfall of Dragonwatch, and as it appears, the lot of you as well. In recent years, our numbers have been hunted out and killed and the reach of Dragonwatch over
                    Zamarok has dwindled." the once dry and dusty wooden floor where she stood now grew moist with drops of tears. (she sighs) "My children are now mostly gone, save for
                    a few special souls.", she gives a sad smile and gestures toward Raya, who sat silently on the floor near the fireplace, her long silver tail wrapped 
                    around her legs.

                    "You lot are being targeted, by the same forces that slaughtered my children. But not for much longer.". she turns to face the party, the candles around
                    the room burning violently, almost hissing. "Join Dragonwatch, there is room for all of you. And I will mould you and give you the power to seek out
                    and smite the mightiest of enemies. whether it be mortals or gods.", the candles around the room seemed to die down to their natural states.
                    "Help me build our ranks once more and restore honor to the halls of DragonWatch. And in return, you shall know power the likes of which Zamarok has not seen
                    in 3 ages."

                (Whats next?)
                - "The bruha Dextra of Midnight Sun, she will know pain far beyond that of any of my children", the candle fires start to flare up again, "but first she will lose everything".
                    "Itova iri [Draconic - 'loved ones'], our first mission is to infiltrate Midnight Sun, we will raid her vaults and take back what is ours, and perhaps more". she smiles and 
                    looks up with fire in her eyes. "But first, we'll need the help of some specialists.", the old woman stares into the fire, lost in thought, and pulls out a poker to stoke its flames. "a halfling,
                    a tiefling and an orc". She turns around to face the party, her tears now replaced with a grin of excitement. "Oh how exciting! We've not done a heist since
                    me and the boys nicked the treasures in king aslims citadel in the north!".

                    Raya looks up in disbelief, her silver scaled face shone a red tinge of embarresment, "Mother!".

                    "Oh come daughter, by now even you should know that not all of our endeavers over the ages have been... Lawful", she smiles innocently.

                (finishing up)
                - "First i suggest you find Alaan looselock the halfling. the old ankle biter has a knack for stealthy missions like these. if were to take everything back from Dextra, he'll know where to start. You'll find
                    the halfling drunk at 'The dancing titan'", The old woman walked up to the fireplace and grabbed a small portrait off the mantle. "Next you'll need to keep an eye out for this young tiefling woman", She
                    hands the party the portrait, which is painted in the image of a sleek looking orange tiefling woman with green eyes and red hair flowing down to her waist. "Lunara Hellborne was once of our ranks, till she
                    left to work for Midnight Sun, ammicably of course... i've heard rumors that she's recently fallen on bad terms with Dextra and has gone into hiding. Find her. Bring her home. No doubt she could help our cause..."
                    She shakes off the worried look on her face "...and lastly we'll need an orc woman, Roxarr Fengarr. her strength is unmatched in GodFell. I happen to know that she'll be defending her title this evening at the trials
                    of Gendrick. do be sure to speak to her too."

                    She turns to Raya, "Itova ir [Draconic - 'loved one'], you must travel into the city for supplies to accomodate our new residents". Raya curtsies toward Vilsara, "It shall be done mother."

                    and poor some mead for the maiden waiting eagerly at the end of the bar with her tray.

                (have your seen alaan?)
                    (looking puzzled) "alaan? you mean looselock? thats the old drunk right there", she gestures toward the end of the bar toward an 
                    old halfling that seems to be talking up a very tall and attractive half elf woman dressed in red, who seemed nearly three times his size.

            Alaan looselock: 
                
                [After being approached]

                    elf woman leans in and whispers into his ear, kisses him on the cheek then leaves. 

                    "Ah, your with villy arent ya? troubling news about yer guild aye ladsh? troubling indeed.", he turns to the bar to finish his drink. 
                    "Villy tellsh me that sticky witch has taken some important things from her. thingsh *hic* she needs returned for the sake of her guild.
                    I CAN help. but first i need you to help me.".

                    The old halfling goes silent for a moment, pondering or perhaps recalling an event that happened long past. "Its my brother, i need his body."

                    The greying thief tells the party about the time he went on a heist with his brother Rada many years ago, that involved going into the Catacombs under the city.
                    while making their escape, they were attacked by ghastly creatures. Alaan managed to escape but his brother never did.

                    "I've never gone down into the Catacombs since... (he sighs) find my brother, please, so that I may finally put him to rest. I'll even pay yee fer
                    the trouble."

                    he hands the party a pale blue orb. "This is enchanted to find our clans badge, it'll grow warm when your close to...", he pauses for a moment then sighs, "to

                seemingly magnify the size of her eyes and smiles, "Im glad to see youre all in one piece. A little yellow bird told me that youve decided to join
                DragonWatch, that fills me with so much joy! oh Vilsara was in need of a fresh pair of muscle to help the guild". Her excitement quickly dwindles, and 
                you can see sadness building behind her oversized spectacles.

                *2 thugs enter the store, look around briefly, then rush out*
                
                [before the party leaves]
                "Wait! Theres a woman here, one who needs your help! Please! Come with me.". She takes the party to the back of the store, and down some stairs to a hidden
                room under the staircase. The room is adorned with a small window that overlooks the river that runs under the bridge, a light breeze blows through the 
                curtain and a on the bed in the middle of the room sat a young bald orange tiefling woman covered in bandages, the woman sat upright with a sudden shock 
                when she heard the door open, almost as if to flee. She had a single green eye and her other eye was greyed out, she was also missing several fingers on 
                both hands and a leg. Her eyes seemed baggy, as if she had not slept and had been weeping.

                Serafia moved slowly toward the girl, then sat beside her and gently stroked her hand. "Her name is Lunara. That spineless no good witch and her cretins from Midnight Sun
                did this to her. DEXTRA! There arent enough magics in the realm to protect you from what im going to do you!", the old woman took a breath to try and fight back the tears 
                that was building in her eyes and regain her composure. "The barbarians cut off her tongue so she couldnt talk... cut off her fingers so she couldnt weave magics... cut off
                her legs so she couldnt run... they defiled her... did things to that would make bhaal himself proud". The old woman spat on the floor.

                "Please, escort the child back to DragonWatch. Vilsara must know whats become of her daughter. Dextra has men looking for her. be careful. Also, im afraid one of you wll have

                    The old womans fingers twitched subtly, as if something within her had finally snapped. she slowly approached the limp tiefling, and placed a gentle hand on her cheek.
