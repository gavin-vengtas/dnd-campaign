Intro:

    Ages pass on the material plane. Old rivers dry out and new rivers form, mountains grow and crumble as
    the passage of time passes. In this age, which some call "the age of legends" or the 4th age to some 
    scholars, 5 unlikely adventurers find themselves on a wagon bound to the town of Godfell.

    In the age of legends, it is said that heroes are forged in the heart of mighty guilds known as adventurers guilds,
    that test their mettle in epic quests and mighty contests. This week, The town of Godfell, home to 3 such guilds, will be hosting
    the festival of Necros ~ also known as the festival of living-death. Despite its name, the festival is a family friendly event
    that many from across the land come to enjoy, featuring many contests of skill, wit and luck ~ which often influences a guilds
    decision to take in new members.

    Each adventurer has received a cryptic note and a Necros Festival Contest invitation, emploring that they come to GodFell imediately, for the fate of 
    mortal planes may depend on them.

    The carriage travels a great distance over treachorous terrain, passed the sites of great battles that ended ages ago.
    where the graves of great titans now lie, also provide a means of venturing such hazards.

    The carriage finally arrives outside the city bridge, coming to an abrupt rest. The driver asks you to kindly disembark as he prepares 
    to find a place of rest for his horses.

Act 1: City gate event    

    The guards at the gate of GodFell are tasked with the responsibility of tracking all newcomers to the city. entrance to the city is prohibited while they prepare for the festival.
    This morning, the city guards guarding the gate are Ed and Ned. (They do not allow entrance to non-locals and non particapants)

Act 4.3: Midnight Sun

    Crowds cheer and make merryment in the distance as our adventurers approach the the dark guild of the midnight sun.

    the movement of guild members in the shadows surrounding the path to the guild. You arrive outside the guild doors.

                    "but the challenge is not yet complete. Before I can admit you to Midnight Sun, I must first know your skills in combat.".

                    She goes on to describe the nearby town of Teakwood, which was plagued by undead many years ago. 
                    Recently the guild had cleared out many monsters from the town save a few that have been barred within the towns old Chapel.

Act 5: Rewards

    Crowds still cheer in the distance as the first night of Necros begins, The cool air has thickened with mist outside the guild hall 
    of the midnight sun. Through the mist, a short stocky figure rushes over to the party, whom you all recognise to be mayor WindFell.

                "Be careful with these 'uns lads, bad luck follows new members of Midnight Sun", He leans in and whispers: "But yee did no hear tha' from me", and leans back.
                "Well, in any case, most of tha shops 'round 'ere are near closed, aye? But i suggest yee stop by Serafias fer yee prizes, she be waitin for ya,
                yee never know when a spell scroll will come in 'andy eh? and while your there, maybe stop by Aldis for some Gear 'fore yee set out". The Mayor stares at Malfeasonce and Galateia,
                "Might I suggest visiting Selkor for your spell materials, He be open still for the festivities, but not for long. Well then, theres much still i must see to..." He runs off..

        Oliver:
            - (Excitedly appraches) "Wow! You have a mission already? I overheard the mayor, shall I show you to Serafias?"

Act 5.1: Serafia [Scrolls] 

    Back on the City gate bridge, the mood grows warm and merry as crowds of festival goers of all races and sizes partake in the festivities on the 
    first night of Necros. Children (and some adults), run back and forth eagerly collecting sweets and confectionaries from locals and other particapants for
    their outfits reflecting the ominous but fun nature of Necros. On one side of the bridge, a group of wizard entertainers weave intricate symbols as reality around them seems to bend
    and form and take shape into fantastic miniature dragons, beholders and aboleths having mighty battles above the crowds. many onlookers cheer and throw in plenty of silver and gold pieces
    for the wizards' performance. On the other side, a lone halfling bard and his band seem to be performing a few songs and gathering quite a crowd.

    Dialog:
        Oliver:
            - (Happily) "Here we are then, Serafias wonderous scroll Emporium... Serafia dont allow me inside no more, not since Aria blew up the bridge a few years ago...",

Act 6: To Teakwood 

    The grounds outside the city gates has grown soft and muddy, no doubt from the sudden increase in foot traffic from visitors for the festival, combined with the cold, damp, misty air.
    The party notices a carriage driver waving after them in the distance.

Act 7: Teakwood Village 

    The moon hangs high in the cloudless sky above the abandoned village of teakwood, illuminating the village in a cold blue light. The Coach
    stops in the middle of the abandoned village, with not a single movement or sign of life, save for howling of wolves and screeching of bats in the distance.

    Dialog:
        Coach:

Act 8: Teakwood Chapel

    A foul stench permeates the the thick mist as the our party appraches the chapel. The once bleached stones of Teakwood chapel is now stained a red/brown from years of wear 
    with no upkeep, clearly visible in the pale blue moonlight. moonlight breaches the inside and illuminates the first level just enough to be considered 'dimly lit', followed 
    by the eerie sound of wind breaking against the tiles on the chapel roof, and leafless tree branches scraping away outside the walls.

    The party notices several unlit sconces on the wall.

Act 9: Vampires!

    The sound of wind and branches wearing down the chapel drowns out as the party decends deeper into the chapel dungeon,
    the smell of corpses now replaced with a faint smell of iron, or perhaps blood, and dust. 

    The party finally reaches the bottom of the stair well. As they enter the next room. It is completely dark, with several unlit sconces on the walls nearby.
    they hear the sudden sound of heavy iron slamming against the concrete floor, barring the doorway behind them.

    Malfeasonce and John Oath broken sense a great evil emanating within the room, the feeling that something terrible is about
    to happen has suddenly dawned on them.

        Encounter:
            Vampire Spawn:
                Following the slamming of the iron gates, barring the adventurers, the Vampire Spawn violently forces off the lid of her coffin.
                the lid flys through the air in a high arc before slamming into the ground, nearly splitting in two. The Vampire Spawn turns to look at
                the destroyed lid, half in surprise and half annoyed about the piece of her bedding being destroyed.

                (in a raspy voice) "... ehh... it seems that my recent feedings has left me stronger than i can remember", she turns to face the party and smiles a toothy grin.
                "How fortunate for you, your deaths shall be quick this night.". She lunges at the nearest party member.

            Vampire: after spawn / party defeat
                Upon the vampire spawns death, the lid of the coffin at the back of the room slides off, and out of it crawls a fully fledged vampire.
                He moves much like a snake slithers, every movement a fluid motion, almost mesmerizing. The vampire looks on at the weakened party, and smiles, revealing a 
                set of sharp teeth not unlike that of a shark.

                (in a cool, transylvanian tone) "My My My, how entertaining that vas. Long has it been since Dextra has sent such a healthy set of adventurers to be slaughtered. 
                Though the last 6 she brought me 2 nights ago did feed me and my follower well..." He eyes the party, "perhaps 1 or 2 of you shall replace her", he lunges at the weakest (health %)
                party member.

        Requirements: 
            - Complete encounter or fail all death saving throws

        DC - Strength: iron gates
           30 - lift iron gates

        Dialog: After the encounter
            Raya:
                - As our adventurers take their final mortal breaths, a faint sound can be heard in the distance, a whisper just beyond the iron gates, and then the building of a hissing sound.
                    the air surrounding the gate begins to shimmer, as a road does in the distance on a hot summers day. Then it starts to glow, first a deep red hue, then brighter, orange, then
                    yellow. until the gate itself began to melt and molten iron seeped down into the cracks in the floors, followed by the caustic smell of noxious gasses. As everything settled, a hooded
                    figure with a silver tail walked confidently into the room.

                    The vampire smiles as his victims blood curdles and bubbles on his shark-like teeth around the edges of his lips, "Ah another adventurer sent by Dextra for me to play vith? You seem more capable than your
                    predecessors". The figure threw back its hood, revealing itself to be what looked like Raya, of the DragonWatch Guild. She smiles. Peeling back her lips to reveal her dragon-like teeth 
                    and then, Before the vampire could react, She pulls out a scroll and whispers a few words.

                    the air around the vampire begins to warp and pull, almost as if space was tearing itself apart at the seems. Suddenly a doorway appeared around the vampire, seemingly
                    leading to nowhere. inside looked like thousands of shooting stars zipping by nearly faster than the eye can see followed with the flashing of all colors of the rainbow, 
                    all of it being pulled to the center of the impossible doorway. it crept on him. Enveloped him. he clawed and scraped on the ground in an effort to keep from being pulled into the vaccuum.
                    but he could not fight the magnitude of the forces that worked against him, and succumbed to it. The doorways suddenly blinks shut, and the vampire is gone.

                    Raya approaches the downed party, and heals/resurrects them. She takes out a few scrolls and speaks some words near the bodies of the fallen party members, as she approaches Vollert,
                    she whispers into his ear, "This one is from Serafia, shes taken quite the liking to you". She then turns to the party, the once Confident Dragonborn women now seemed rather flustered
                    almost shy, "Well, uhm, I know you all must be terribly exhausted after that...", she turns to look at the corpse of the vampire spawn, "...Ordeal, but we must leave this place post haste. The uh
                    Vampire will be back soon, I wont be able to stop him this time, all the scrolls that Vilsara bought are finished... We must go back to DragonWatch, There are great forces at play that
                    tried to make sure that you all would not survive this night. Come!"

Act 10: Return to Godfell

    the sky shines a purple-red hue as sunrise breaks the horizons overlooking the village of teakwood, 5 unlikely adventurers ventured into the chapel at midnight.
    Now 6 return, a surprised coach looks on as the adventurers all approach him, now looking far more battered and bruised than when they first arrived.

    Dialog:
        Coach:
            - (In utter surprise), "Well I'll be, In all my months of bringing sorry adventurers to this god forsaken place, i aint never seen a whole group return, much less with 1 extra!",
                the coaches eyes narrowed then widened as he recognised the hooded Dragonborn woman approaching, "L-Lady Raya!?", the coach pulled off his hat and wrung it in is hands before clutching
                it against his chest, "Ma'am i can explai~", before finishing his sentence, Raya had briskly walked up to the coach and swiftly slapped him accross the face, sending his hat flying into the
                bushes, "Len, You will not speak another word. you will get back on your cart and take us back to DragonFell, or you can count on the seven heavens that your wife will hear about this before Vilsara does.
                Nod If you understand me.". Tearing up, The coach nods in compliance and boards the carriage, awaiting his passengers.

        Raya:
            - (Nervously) "Well im sure you all have...", She looks around, trying not to make eye contact with anyone, "...Questions. I'll try to answer some of them the best i can on the ride back 
            to GodFell."

    Shortly after boarding, the party starts to feel the toll of the stress of all the activities that took place over the last day, your bodies start to feel weak and your eyes feel heavy. 
    one by one, everyone eventually blacks out.

    Act Milestones:

        back at GodFell, At Rayas request, Ed, Ned and Oliver help move the unconscious adventurers back into DragonWatch. 
        The smell and burning incense and dusty books infiltrate your senses as you all come to. Before you, Stands Raya in front of a fireplace stairing in silent contemplation.
        Next to Galateia is Oliver, who is still asleep but you recognise that his eyes are a bit puffy, as if he had been up late or crying.

        Dialog:
            Raya: 
                - (Her head bends slightly as she realises the party is awake), "ah, it seems you are all awake. That one hasnt left your side. It seems you've all left quite the impression",
                    she turns to look at Oliver with a pained look on her face, and sighs, "I fear that your presence may spell the death for him". 

                (Why was she there at teakwood?)
                - (Nervously) "I-Ive been Investigating the disappearences of potential new recruits over the last year... It seems recently that our numbers have been dwindling, with nobody 
                    truly joining our ranks anymore, i just had to investigate...", she takes a deep breath, then exhales to try to control her contempt. "When I had learned that you had chosen Midnight Sun and 
                    that... that witch!...", she slammed her fist against the wall holding the fireplace, making the rafters above shudder. "The Mayor and the boy told me she sent you to teakwood, thats when it dawned on me..."
                    you notice blood drip onto the floor, stemming from her fist clenched far too tightly which now rested on the wall above the fireplace. "She's been poaching them and sending them to be slaughtered!"
                    the tiny puddlle of blood collected on the floor now mixed with dripping tears.

                (How did she beat the vampire?)
                - (confidently, somewhat Excitedly) "Oh ive had my suspicions of teakwood for quite some time!", the party spots the edge of her tail swishing through the air, "Vilsara, our guildmaster, 
                    insisted that I have those scrolls on me given the nature of thee forces that work against us"

            Vilsara:
                - After some time, a door can be heard creaking in the distance, and suddenly the wooden door leading to the room bursts open and in rushes an elderly woman ~ a human looking woman who looks well into her 
                    70s or 80s and dressed in a dark blue dress and a matching shawl, with platted grey hair down to her waist. (Excitedly) "Raya! Daughter! you'll never believe this! the dragons! they've returned to GodFell!"
                    The old woman suddenly realises her adoptive daughter isn't alone, and turns to examine the party and smiles knowingly as she recognises each member. "Oh good, you received my note! AND youre still in one piece!"
