Intro:

Ages pass on the material plane. Old rivers dry out and new rivers form, mountains grow and crumble as
the passage of time passes. In this age, which some call "the age of legends" or the 4th age to some 
scholars, 5 unlikely adventurers find themselves on a wagon bound to the town of Godfell.

In the age of legends, it is said that heroes are forged in the heart of mighty guilds known as adventurers guilds,
that test their mettle in epic quests and mighty contests. This week, The town of Godfell, home to 3 such guilds, will be hosting
the festival of Necros ~ also known as the festival of living-death. Despite its name, the festival is a family friendly event
that many from across the land come to enjoy, featuring many contests of skill, wit and luck ~ which often influences a guilds
decision to take in new members.

Each adventurer has received a cryptic note and a Necros Festival Contest invitation, emploring that they come to GodFell imediately, for the fate of 
mortal planes may depend on them.

The carriage travels a great distance over treachorous terrain, passed the sites of great battles that ended ages ago.
where the graves of great titans now lie, also provide a means of venturing such hazards.

The carriage finally arrives outside the city bridge, coming to an abrupt rest. The driver asks you to kindly disembark as he prepares 
to find a place of rest for his horses.
